# Snake Game in Python using Pygame

This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Python and the Pygame library. Players can control the snake's direction, eat fruits to grow, and accumulate scores while avoiding collisions with the borders and the snake's own body.

## Features:
- Responsive arrow key controls for snake movement.
- Fruit spawning and score tracking.
- Collision detection for game over scenarios.

## How to Play:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install Pygame (`pip install pygame`).
3. Run the Python script (`python snake_game.py`).

Feel free to explore and modify the code to enhance or customize the game further. Enjoy gaming!
